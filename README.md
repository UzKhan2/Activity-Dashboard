# Activity Dashboard

A comprehensive web application that aggregates and displays the user's activity across multiple sites. The dashboard provides statistics, visualizations, and activity feeds for each service. It utilizes various methods to retrieve this information: from official APIs and clients to unofficial APIs, retrieving RSS feeds, parsing through webpages and HTML, along with authentication tokens. This is all fed back into the dashboard, providing an overview of the user's info.
